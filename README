Intro
=====
eco32f is a pipelined version of the eco32 architecture:
http://opencores.org/project,eco32

The 'f' in the name stands for fast, full or five
(as the number of pipeline stages), pick your choice.

The design is a "schoolbook" example of the classic RISC pipeline,
a single issue, five stage pipeline with interlocks.
